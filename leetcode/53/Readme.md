# [877. Stone Game (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/)

<p>Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.&nbsp; There are an even number of&nbsp;piles <strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to end with the most&nbsp;stones.&nbsp; The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.</p>

<p>Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.&nbsp; Each turn, a player&nbsp;takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.&nbsp; This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.</p>

<p>Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return <code>True</code>&nbsp;if and only if Alex wins the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> piles = [5,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>piles.length</code> is even.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>sum(piles)</code> is odd.</li>
</ul>

## Solution 1.

```py  
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, piles: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        ## DFS --> LTE
        
        ## DP
        ## dp(i, j) be the largest score Alex can achieve where the piles remaining are piles[i], piles[i+1], ..., piles[j]


        N = len(piles)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            # The value of the game [piles[i], piles[i+1], ..., piles[j]].
            if i > j: return 0
            parity = (j - i - N) % 2
            if parity == 1:  # first player
                return max(piles[i] + dp(i+1,j), piles[j] + dp(i,j-1))
            else:
                return min(-piles[i] + dp(i+1,j), -piles[j] + dp(i,j-1))

        return dp(0, N - 1) > 0
